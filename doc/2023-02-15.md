# Meeting with Iulia Wednesday 15 February

## Feedback about Project plan
- Feedback from Joachim von Hacht is a little harsh and he doesn't fully
  understand our text it feels like, we should contact him about the grade.

## Feedback for report
- Go to Iulia first, she then can contact Francisco in case of need.

## Thesis

- Good to start early drafting the thesis, you should start now
- Sections are not bound to a structure
- Introduction: Background, Motivation, (Related work)
- If you find good paper you have read, make very short summary of the paper in
  the Related work section (save the pdf)
- Problem: (split into two sections)
- Avgr√§nsningar: keep for thesis.
- No need of Tidsplan

## Weekly plan

- Have another tasks for thesis (each week everyone write a bit in the report).
  Could be a sentence if not a paragraph or an item (as a habit).
- Note down what has been done during that week.
- If you are trying something and it doesn't work, note it down. To keep track,
  might go into final report. To argue your choices in the thesis.

## TODO
- Monday: have a first draft. Split tasks among yourselves. Talk about the
  headers.
- Spend time to talk about the report in the meetings.
- Halvtidsredovisning in 3 weeks. Who is going to present? Those who present
  here won't be in the final presentation. What are we going to talk about? The
  project and the state of it, what you have to do.

## Meeting ends 13:40
